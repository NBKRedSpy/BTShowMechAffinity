# Battletech Show Mech Affinity

An extension for the Mech Affinity mod.  This mod shows which pilots have an affinity with a specific chassis.
Rather than opening each tool tip for a pilot to determine if they have an affinity, the pilot list will be colored and sorted by level of affinity for the selected mech.

When in the contract loadout screen, click on a mech to show the pilot affinities.

## Usage
When in the contract loadout screen, click on a mech and all the pilots will have the rank icon changed to a color baseD on the pilot's affinity.

The pilots on the right of the screen will also be sorted by the  number of drops with the selected mech and then by name.


## The affinity colors are:

|Affinity level| color|
|--|--|
|No Affinity (0) | Black|
| < 10| Grey|
| < 20| Green|
| < 30| Blue|
| < 50| Purple|
| >= 50| Gold|

# Requirements
Requires the Mech Affinity mod to be installed.  Some Battletech projects will already have it installed.  For example, Battletech Extended Comander Edition has Mech Affinity installed.
